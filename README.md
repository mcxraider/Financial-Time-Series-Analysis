Machine Learning Time Series Analysis Model to Predict Stock Price

Project Start Date: 10 October 2200
Project End Date: 24 October 2359

## Task
Predict the closing stock price of NASDAQ: NVDA for trading days from 25 October - 7
November (inclusive). Predictions will be compared with actual (after 7 November,
but you have to submit before 24 October) using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). The lower the RMSE, the more accurate
the prediction.

## Implementation 1: Long-Short-Term-Memory Model


## Implementation 2: ARIMA Model
